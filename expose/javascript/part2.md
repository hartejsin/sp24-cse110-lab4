# 1 
At line 12, we log 3 since that is the value of i after the for loop ends. 

# 2
Line 13 logs 150 since this is the final discountedPrice(300/2) in our for loop. 

# 3
Line 14 also logs 150 since this is the value of finalPrice on the last iteration of our for loop. 

# 4
The function returns [50,100,150) since this is the discounted prices. However, the return does not output anything in our terminal and we must log our function call to see this array of prices. 

# 5
Reference error because i is only available inside the for loop. 

# 6
Reference error because discountedPrices is only avaible inside the for loop. 

# 7
Logs 150 since that is the last finalPrice.

# 8
The function returns [50,100,150) since this is the discounted prices. However, the return does not output anything in our terminal and we must log our function call to see this array of prices. 

# 9
Reference error since i is not defined outside the for loop.

# 10 
Logs 3 since that is the length of prices and it is constant. 

# 11
The function returns [50,100,150) since this is the discounted prices. However, the return does not output anything in our terminal and we must log our function call to see this array of prices.

=== checks if the types of the two variables and values are the same. == will try to perform type conversion first, then check for equality

# 17
The function returns a newArray with all the values of the previous array doubled. This is because modifyArray iterates through our array and pushes the result of the callback function on the current iteration to a new array. So 1,2,3 becomes 2,4,6.

Logs 1 and 4, then 2 and 3 after waiting 1 second.
